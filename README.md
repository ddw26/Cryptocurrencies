# Cryptocurrencies

## Brief Overview 
__________________________________________________________________

After completing the research, Martha- Senior Manager in the Advisory Services Dept at Accountability Accounting Investment Bank- and I are tasked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system. The purpose of this task is so that the aforementioned bank can eventually offer new cryptocurrency investment portfolios for its customers. Since we have gained a better understanding about unsupervised learning, data processing, clustering, dimension reduction, and reducing principal components using PCA, we are estatic to help the bank dive into the unknown seas of cryptocurrency. The data Martha and I worked with was not ideal, so we processed it to fit the machine learning models. With no output in mind, we opted to use unsupervised machine learning. Lasly, we grouped the cryptocurrencies on a clustering algorithm and used data visualizations to share our findings with the board.
